    <p>Used svg.com to find out why the Switch uses cartridges over disks. I used tweaktown.com's "Nintendo comments on Switch's low end power",
        and venturebeat.com's "Nintendo Switch: less powerful than PS4" article to explain why the Switch is less powerful than the PS4 and Xbox One.
        I found the image of the Switch on pocket-link.com's "Nintendo Switch 2: Everything we know so far"

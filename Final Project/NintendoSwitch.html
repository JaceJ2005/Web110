        <h1>About the Nintendo Switch</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Nintendo Switch was released on March 3, 2017 and it was Nintendo's first home console + portable console hybrid. It is Nintendo's most recent console 
            and was released in the 8th generation. It competed with the Playstation 4 and Xbox One and is now competing with the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X.
        It works as a handheld but can also be connected to the TV through it's dock, hence the name Nintendo Switch. It also comes with two controllers connected to each side 
        of the console. It recently became one of the best-selling consoles, rivaling the Playstation 2 in sales.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Switch uses cartridges because they are much smaller than disks, which is important since the Switch is also a handheld console. 
                Having a disc reader would have made it much larger and heavier, and Cartridges also take less power to run. Also,
            the Switch would have to be more bulky in order for it to fit in a disc drive, and that would result in lower battery life</li>
            <li>The Switch is less powerful than the PS4 and Xbox One because Nintendo focuses on selling their systems at a specific price point, which is typically 
                lower than the competition. To meet this price point they have to make sacrifices such as having a less powerful processor. This also results in some games
                having graphics that're inferior to its competition. Nintendo also needs to scale back their games and decrease resolution and frame rates to have them run on the Switch.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Although the Switch is considered a previous generation console and is often considered inferior to the PS5 and Xbox Series X, it is still quite the 
        popular console. There are a lot of reasons for this such as it having popular games such as Mario and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and Nintendo consoles tend to be popular in general
    which isn't surprising since they have so many popular games.</h3>

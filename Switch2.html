            <h1>About the Switch 2</h1>
        </header>
    <h2>What we know so far</h2>
    <p>The Switch 2 is said to be released some time this year, possibly in April. It will be backwards compatible with the current Switch games and controllers,
        but some games might not work on the Switch 2. Unlike the Switch OLED model, the Switch 2 will not have an OLED screen, and there will be a second USB port on the top of the console,
        but it will share most of the current Switch's features. The Switch 2's Joycon controllers and their buttons will be larger, but they will lose the slide-in connectivity and will instead
        lock in via a port on each side of the console. The console will also have a higher frame rate and resolution, which Nintendo claims will be on par with Sony and Microsoft's current consoles.
        It will also have more storage and a custom invidia chip. The Switch's online service will also be carried over to the Switch 2.
    </p>
    <h3>Games</h3>
    <p>The only confirmed games on the Switch 2 are a new Mario Kart game, the upcoming Pokemon Legends Z-A, Secret Forest, My Time at Evershine, and Bestiario. It is safe to assume
        that there will be another new Pokemon game and a new Zelda game as well, and there is a possibility that another Smash Bros. game will be made as well. Some also theorize that Red Dead Redemption 2 and tne Final Fantasy 7 remake
        will be released on it as well.
